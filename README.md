## Hello! I'm Gavin. I am a software developer focused on game development.

### Projects
I am working on two projects, RhythmCatch (which is a rhythm game inspired by osu!'s fruit catching gamemode), and Mercury (which is a C# .NET Framework based anticheat).

### Work
Soon (3-4 years), I might consider working at Roblox. This is because the moderation on their platform isn't the best at the moment, especially with people who use modified game clients/memory modification tools to gain an advantage. Since I know some C++
along with other programming languages, I may be able to join the moderation team or work on Hyperion.

### Age
Currently, I am 14 (almost 4 months away from being 15).

### Pronouns
Mainly going by He/Him, but you can call me something else if you would like (I don't really mind).

### Programming Experience
I have been developing software 5+ years ago, with years of experience with languages like C# and Lua. I also know quite a bit about C++ and Java (Java since I've worked on various Minecraft server plugins).

### Contacts
If you would like to contact me, my email is gavinreid@null.net. I also have a Discord (username is te1amon).
